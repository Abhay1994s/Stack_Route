Part - A
Make use of the following inbuilt api's

   1) min
   2) max
   3) mean
   4) argmin
   5) argmax
   6) linalg.solve
   7) flatten
   8) ravel
   9) dot Product
   10) * for Matrix (Element wise multiplication)
   11) arange followed by reshape
   12) identity / eye
   13) sum
   14) diag
   15) tril / triu
