In this file I have calculated the male and female count on the basis of genre.

In Part 1: I have plot a histogram of user count based on Ratings given by user.

In Part 2: I have plot a Bar Graph of user count based on age.

In Part 3: First I filtered the data and merge the 3 files u.item, u.user and u.data, after that I have plot a stacked bar chart of male and female on the basis of genre.

Results:
Part 1: In this graph we can easily see that people with user ID less than 100 rated more movies as compared to the other.

Part 2: In this graph plot people between age 20-30 prefer to watch more movies as compared to other.

Part 3: from this stacked bar we can see that people prefer to watch Drama movies more compared to other genre.

I this part I have sort and plot my data on the basis of occupation.

Results:

First Graphs (Movie Rating vs Movie Id):
In this graph we can easily see that people with movie ID less than 60 watched by many peoples.

Second Graph(Movie count vs Occupation):
From this graph we can easily see that the Students watch more movies and Doctors least.

Third Graph(Stacked bar chart of genre on the basis of Occupation to check what types(genre) of movies watched by people on the basis of occupation):
From this graph we can analyse that the Students watch more movies and people mostly watch Drama,Comedy and Action movies.

Fourth Graph(Analysis of people who watch very less movies):
In this graph I am getting the same result as previous(people prefer to watch Drama movies as compared to others)
