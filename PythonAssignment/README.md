Aim:
Implementation of the Steffensen Method in Python.

Background:
In numerical analysis, Steffensen’s method is a root-finding technique similar to Newton’s. Steffensen’s method also achieves quadratic convergence, but without using derivatives as Newton’s method does. The simplest form of the formula for Steffensen’s method occurs when it is used to find the zeros, or roots, of a function f that is to find the values of x*, that satisfies f(x*)=0.

Equation: (x*x)-(2*x)-56
p0 = 0.7
tol = 0.0005


Steffensen_part2.py
Equation: (2*x*x)+(9*x)-100
p0 = 0.5
tol = 0.0001
